# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

## Project Overview
This project applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and determine the sentiment towards products. By understanding customer sentiments, businesses can make informed decisions about product improvements and customer service strategies.

## Objective
To develop a sentiment analysis model that classifies customer reviews into positive, neutral, or negative categories and to visualize these sentiments alongside sales data to identify correlations.

## Techniques Used
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques to process and analyze text data from customer reviews.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for deep learning-based sentiment classification.
- **Data Visualization**: Tools to illustrate sentiment trends over time and their correlation with product sales.

## Data Requirements
- **Customer Reviews and Ratings**: Text data from customer feedback along with associated ratings.
- **Product Data**: Information including sales figures, prices, and categories to correlate with sentiment data.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Collection**: Gather customer reviews and product data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare text data for analysis.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Implement various NLP models.
   - Evaluate and select the best-performing model.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Develop a dashboard to display sentiment analysis results.
   - Correlate sentiment data with product sales and other relevant metrics.
5. **Reporting**: Compile findings into an actionable report for decision-making.

## Dashboard Concept
- **Sentiment Over Time**: A line graph showing sentiment trends across different time periods.
- **Sentiment Breakdown**: A pie chart displaying the proportion of positive, neutral, and negative reviews.
- **Sales vs. Sentiment**: A scatter plot correlating sentiment scores with product sales.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the analysis scripts to generate sentiment analysis.
4. Launch the dashboard to view the results interactively.
